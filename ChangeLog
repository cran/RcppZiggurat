	* DESCRIPTION: Version 0.1.2

2014-01-22  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* NAMESPACE: Add importFrom(Rcpp, evalCpp) needed for next Rcpp

2013-12-29  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* demo/notForCRANbenchmark.R: Updates to the benchmark deploying the
	generators from Boost, Armadillo and the C++11 library -- none of
	which are particularly fast.
	* demo/notForCRANbenchmark.cpp: Idem for C++ side of benchmark

	* .travis.yml: Do not install highlight as we check without vignettes

	* man/ziggurat.Rd: Updated and extended basic manual page

2013-12-28  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* inst/include/ZigguratR.h (Ziggurat): Added a generator which uses
	R's unif_rand() as a source of uniform RNG -- so that we can seed it
	from R when Ziggurat is used as the user-supplied generator
	* src/ziggurat.cpp: Make generator available as user_norm_rand()

2013-12-22  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: Version 0.1.1
	* DESCRIPTION: Added 'Depends: R (>= 3.0.0)' as we use the vignette

2013-12-21  Dirk Eddelbuettel  <edd@debian.org>

	* DESCRIPTION: Version 0.1.0

	* Numerous changes made since the previous version:
	  - cleaner implementation using virtual base class and namespaces
	  - better split between header files in inst/include and src
	  - new open source implementations from Gretl and QuantLib
	  - added three tests: chi^2 as in Leong et al, standard test common
	    for uniform generators, new adapted standard test
	  - added three tests also as user-accessible functions, and as demos
	  - added vignette describing method, implementation, statistical
  	    tests and properties, as well as generator speed comparison
